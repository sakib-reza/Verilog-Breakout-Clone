# Verilog Breakout Clone
A simple "pong" game made in Verilog. Similar to breakout clone. My high score was 16 on the highest speed.

## Overview 
For this project, we were tasked with creating a Brickbreaker (the old Blackberry game) type game on a microcontroller, played with a keyboard, and display it using a VGA monitor. To take it further, we implemented further features like a highscore system, different ball speeds, number of lives and "bat" size modifiers.

## Hardware
- Intel Cyclone IV on the Altera DE2-115 board
- PS/2 Keyboard
- VGA Monitor
